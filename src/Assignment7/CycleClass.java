2) Create a Cycle class, with subclasses Unicycle, Bicycle and Tricycle.
  Add a balance( ) method to Unicycle and Bicycle, but not to Tricycle.
  Create instances of all three types and upcast them to an array of Cycle.
   Try to call balance( ) on each element of the array and observe the results.
 Downcast and call balance( ) and observe what happens.
